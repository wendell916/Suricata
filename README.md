# Suricata IDS

# What is Suricata?

Suricata is an open-source network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), as well as a network monitoring tool. This documentation is based on version 7.0.8, which is the latest at the time of writing. Developed by the Open Information Security Foundation (OISF), Suricata uses pre-defined signatures to detect anomalies or threats within a network.

# Features of Suricata

* Intrusion Detection and Prevention (IDS/IPS): Suricata detects and prevents known threats by using signatures, which are pre-defined rules.

* Network Security Monitoring: Suricata provides detailed metadata about network flows, including flow duration, packet counts, and byte counts.

* Deep Packet Inspection (DPI): It analyzes network traffic in detail, including the application layer (e.g., HTTP, DNS, FTP, SMTP).

* Protocol Detection and Logging: Suricata supports decoding and logging of protocols such as HTTP, TLS, FTP, and DNS.

# How Does Suricata Work?

Suricata listens to network traffic via a network interface card (NIC) configured in promiscuous mode.

The captured traffic is analyzed against known or configured signatures.

If a match is found, an alert is generated.

Logs are created containing metadata, protocol details, and addresses for deeper investigation.

# Problem Statement

Without a robust intrusion detection and prevention system like Suricata, network traffic remains vulnerable to threats that can progress unchecked. The lack of traffic analysis increases the risk of regulatory non-compliance, delayed incident response, incomplete forensic investigations, and reduced threat intelligence. Organizations become reactive and vulnerable to evolving cyber threats.

# Objective

To enhance threat detection and identify network anomalies, addressing the issues highlighted in the problem statement.

# Tools Used

* Ubuntu Server

* VMware

# Project Scope

* This project provides a detailed guide on installing Suricata on an Ubuntu server, analyzing, monitoring, and generating alerts for investigation and remediation.

* Limitation: This project focuses only on the IDS functionality of Suricata. It uses an out-of-band network architecture that listens to traffic but cannot prevent attacks actively.

# Implementation Process

# Requirements

For optimal performance, Suricata recommends:

At least 2 CPU cores

4 GB of RAM

Project Setup:

7 GB of RAM

2 CPU cores

# Installation

Install Ubuntu Server.


Run the following commands in the ubuntu terminal:

``````

sudo apt-get install software-properties-common

``````


``````

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:oisf/suricata-stable

``````


``````

sudo apt update

``````

``````

sudo apt install suricata jq

``````

Verify Suricata's status with the command 

``````

sudo systemctl status suricata


``````

Determine the interface and IP address of the server:

ip a

Configure Suricata:

Use a preferred text editor (e.g., nano):

nano /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml

Modify the following:

Home_Net Section: Update the IP address of the local network.

AF-Packet Section: Set the interface to the one used by your network.

Update signatures:

sudo suricata-update
sudo systemctl restart suricata

Testing Suricata

Perform an aggressive Nmap scan on the server running Suricata.

View alerts:

tail -f /var/log/suricata/fast.log

Alerts generated from the Nmap scan can be found in /var/log/suricata/fast.log.

Challenges

Due to a NIC that doesnâ€™t support promiscuous mode, I was unable to monitor all traffic on the network, except for the Ubuntu server hosting Suricata.

Results

Learned how Suricata works.

Understood how rules generate alerts.

Successfully installed and deployed Suricata.

Future Enhancements

Integration with Wazuh (Open-source SIEM): Display alerts directly on a dashboard in real-time, eliminating the need for manual checks.
